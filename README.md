Fourier-parametrized bytewise audio synthesis software

This is an attempt at a low-level digital audio workstation (DAW) without any graphical interface.

WAV files are generated from configuration files that supply note information. Every note is parametrized by its Fourier decomposition.

## History

The first codes date back to late 2016.
