# fpbass

Fpbass, pronounced "Ef-pEE-bAYs", short for "Fourier-parametrized bytewise audio synthesis software", is an attempt at a low-level digital audio workstation (DAW) without any graphical interface. The idea is to compose experimental electronic music quickly from the terminal, as an alternative to GUI-based DAWs.

WAV files are generated from configuration files that supply note information. Every note is parametrized by its Fourier decomposition.

## History

The first codes date back to late 2016, in the context of the noise music project [Struct](http://struct.square7.ch/).

In 2020, the work on a first publishable version began.

## Contribute

When this project is made public, you can in principle contribute to it. Small stuff can be done at any time. I will name larger challenges under "Issues".

Please look at [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md) to see how and where one can contribute.
