# Contribute

If you would like to contribute to Fpbass, feel free to fork the project and submit pull requests.

At some point I will name some specific open tasks under "Issues". But before that, here are some first ideas:

* improve the code efficiency
* allow for panning, such that left and right channels will differ
* write a simple editor of the configuration files with a button (or shortcut) to generate the audio output (To keep things simple and low-level, there is no typical DAW GUI planned.)
